# Frontend nanodegree: Arcade Game Clone

## How it works:

This game runs on javascript. **Engine.js** is the game loop that continually updates and renders the objects. 
**Resources.js** is the image loading utility that also caches images for performance purposes. 
**App.js** contains the game logic and instantiates the objects (enemies, player, gems, rocks).

## Instructions: How to play

- Download the repo to your computer and open/load the index.html file in your browser. Use the keyboards directional arrows (UP, DOWN,     LEFT, RIGHT) to move the player around the board and finally reach the water.
- Score points by collecting the gems while navigating the player to the water without colliding with its enemies. 
- Colliding with the enemies resets the player to its starting position and decrements the score.

## Game highlights

- Gain points every time you reach the water or collect a gem.
- Lose points every time you hit a bug.
